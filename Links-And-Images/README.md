## INTRODUCTION
### No. 3. Links and Images
This section captures a subjective view of the important topics discussed in the links and images section.
#### Key Notes:
- Links point users to different HTML pages while images pull another resource into a page.
- There are three types of URLs: absolute, relative, and root-relative links.
- Absolute links refers to pages in your own site, however its best practice to use absolute links to an entirely different website.
- Relative links point to another file in your website from the point of the file you're referring from. This also refers to files above, in a different directory.
- Root-relative links, point relative to the root of the entire website. Root-relative links start with a forward slash.
- Naming convention and best practices state that files should be named with lowercase characters and not use spaces but underlines.
- There are four main image formats on the web: JPG, GIF, PNG, and SVG.
- JPG images are designed to handle large color palattes without large file sizes, however they don't allow transparent pixels.
- GIF images have limited color-palatte but provide simple animations.
- PNG images are typically preferred as they can deal with opacity. Generally they have similiar qualities to JPG however they tend to be larger.
- SVG images are vector-based graphics meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality and makes it ideal for responsive designs. The only drawback to SVGS are that any text fields outlined in the images will need to be edited in image editors and can have a big impact on size.
