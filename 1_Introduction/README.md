## INTRODUCTION
### No. 1. of HTML & CSS is Hard
This section captures a subjective view of the important topics discussed in the introduction section.
#### Key Notes:
• HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.
• CSS is for formatting that marked up content
• JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive.

Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is only a prerequisite for becoming a professional developer. There are more practical skills that you need.
• Organizing HTML into reusable templates
• Standing up a web server
• Moving files from your local computer to your web server
• Reverting to a previous version when you screw something up
• Pointing a domain name at your server
### Web Publishing
Learning HTML and CSS is a matter of understanding the available HTML markup and CSS rules to make a browser render those files exactly how they're supposed to.
### Fundamentals, Not Frameworks
There are all sorts of front-end web development frameworks out there (React, Vue, Bootstrap, just to name a few). The goal of every single one of them is to abstract away some of the redundant aspects of creating web pages from scratch.
### Tools of the Trade
It is important to write code in a text editor. This topic is subjective and recommends ATOM. It's user friendly for beginners but my personal choice is VSCode.
